# 🚀 Experiment 6 – React Forms & Client-Side Validation

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of:

- **Experiment 1:** Handling Forms Using Controlled Components  
- **Experiment 2:** Client-Side Form Validation  

The project demonstrates how to create forms in React using controlled components and implement client-side validation before form submission.

# 🧪 Experiment 1: Handling Forms Using Controlled Components

## 🎯 Aim
To create and handle forms in a frontend application using controlled components in React.

## 💻 Software Requirements
- Node.js  
- React  
- VS Code  
- Web Browser  

## 📖 Theory
Controlled components are React components in which form data is handled by the component’s state. This provides complete control over user input and allows dynamic validation and manipulation of form values.

In controlled components:
- Input values are stored in state.
- `useState` hook manages the form data.
- `onChange` events update the state.
- Form submission is handled through an event handler.

## 🔧 Procedure
1. Create a React application using `create-react-app` or Vite.
2. Create a form component.
3. Use `useState` to store input values.
4. Handle input change events.
5. Submit the form using an event handler.

# 🧪 Experiment 2: Client-Side Form Validation

## 🎯 Aim
To validate form inputs on the client side before submission.

## 📖 Theory
Client-side validation ensures correctness of user data and provides immediate feedback without server interaction. It improves user experience and reduces unnecessary server requests.

Validation checks may include:
- Required fields
- Minimum/maximum length
- Email format validation
- Password strength validation
- Numeric input validation

## 🔧 Procedure
1. Create form inputs.
2. Define validation conditions.
3. Display error messages.
4. Allow submission only for valid data.
